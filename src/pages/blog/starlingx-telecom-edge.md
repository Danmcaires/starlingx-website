Moving intelligence to the edge of the telecom network. <!-- more -->

Just as the evolution of the smart phone was enabled by the transition from 3G to 4G, use cases for connected devices will evolve with 5G. There will be connected appliances, connected cars, connected factories and even connected cities that will each require the low latency and localized processing power of 5G to function. For communications service providers (CSPs), meeting the challenges of 5G isnâ€™t simply a matter of building bigger networks. Instead, they will need to break down their big networks into smaller, disaggregated components that are closer to the source of these connected devices.

In this new network model, the edge becomes increasingly important. Unlike the core-centric network model of the past, 5G networks will require much of the heavy lifting of processing and analytics to be performed closer to the user, running on a very small footprint. In the case of smart factories, the edge could be multi-access edge computing (MEC) within a hosted private 5G network. For online gaming, this could mean adding compute capacity to the edge of the telecom network. In both cases, CSPs will need to deploy these edge resources quickly and cost-effectively if they hope to monetize 5G opportunities.

Edge use cases come with unique requirements and even with the building blocks in hand, it is not easy to build the infrastructure that can power Radio Access Networks (RAN). StarlingX is an open source cloud platform that is built and developed with these needs in mind to address the pain points that telecom operators face and brings in efficiency both in terms of deploying as well as operating infrastructure. To mention an example, Vodafone is utilizing the platform to power the first commercial Open RAN rollout in Europe.
