- Universal Customer Premise Equipment (CPE): 20%
- Virtual Radio Access Network (RAN): 3%
- Healthcare: 3%

Among the organizations selecting ‘Other,’ use cases included research in edge computing, uCPE, IoT nodes and gateways, and edge compute for very small clusters.

Organizations who have completed the StarlingX User Survey have requested to remain anonymous.
