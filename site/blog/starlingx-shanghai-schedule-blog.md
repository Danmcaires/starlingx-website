You can meet the StarlingX community at the upcoming [Open Infrastructure Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit/shanghai-2019/) in Shanghai, November 4-6. The community will join 30 other open source projects attending the Summit to collaborate in the open. If you want to be part of it too [register now](http://openstack.org/summit/shanghai-2019) before prices increase on August 14 at 11:59pm PT.

For 2019, the Summit has expanded and rebranded from the OpenStack Summit to the Open Infrastructure Summit, reflecting the large number of open source tools used to automate modern infrastructure and the challenges of integrating them. The agenda for the event is now live with a full track around edge computing and 5G featuring a number of StarlingX talks.

The StarlingX community will also participate in collaborative sessions offered at the [Forum](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Forum), where open infrastructure operators and upstream developers will gather to jointly chart the long-term future of open source projects.

Additionally, the team is actively planning their participation at the [Project Teams Gathering](https://www.openstack.org/ptg) (PTG) event thatâ€™s co-located with with the Shanghai Summit, November 5-8. The PTG offers dedicated meeting space for technical communities to have focused project-specific hack time together in person, onboarding of new contributors, and also to collaborate with adjacent open source communities. You can follow the planning if you are interested in attending the sessions [here](https://www.openstack.org/ptg).
